# Armox Botnet

A simple piece of malware developped in Python with some functionalities like a botnet, a keylogger and a ddos.

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Note
This software isn't designed to work on Linux except for the server side. So i would recommend you to install it on Windows and on a virtual macine because the software is going to create register keys for the persistance.

For a better explanation, you can read the report present on the repository (in french) or take a look at the UML.

### Prerequisites
- Installing [pip3](https://vgkits.org/blog/pip3-windows-howto/)
- Installing the externals libraries
	```batch
	pip3 install pynput
	pip3 install requests
	```
- Installing a text editor of your choice (we're using pyCharm)

## Deployement
The program is using argparse, like that you can choose on which ip address and on which port you would like to start it.
Once launched, the register key is created with the argument that you choose.
You need to start the server first otherwise your client won't be able to connect
```batch
client.py -a server_ip_address -p server_port
```
.bat files are present as an example
